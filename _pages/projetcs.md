## Projects

#### Project: Île-de-France Accident Severity Prediction API

This is an end-to-end data science project that builds a complete web application to predict road accident severity in the Île-de-France region.

The final product is a **Dockerized Flask API** that serves a machine learning model through an interactive web interface. Users can click on a map of Paris, fill in details about an accident (like the time, weather, and vehicle type), and receive a real-time prediction for the probability of the outcome being **'Severe'** (Killed or Hospitalized) or **'Light'**.

#### Project: Exoplanet identification project

This is an applied statistics and machine learning project in **R**, aiming to identify true exoplanets to false exoplanets, using NASA database.

#### Project: Hospital Beds Scheduling 

This is a project completed during a challenge during my education to schedule beds occupation in a hospital with constraints such as less occupation during week ends.

A prototype have been built using **genetic algorithm** with some tuning about the scoring.
